Here’s a clean **GitHub repository README draft** you can use for your project:

# 🚀 Near Real-Time Retail Sales ETL Pipeline on AWS

This project demonstrates how to build a **serverless near real-time ETL pipeline** for retail sales data using AWS services. The pipeline ingests raw data from stores, processes it, and delivers curated datasets for analytics.

---

## 📌 Architecture Flow

**S3 (Raw Data) → SQS (Buffering) → Lambda (Event Handler) → Step Functions (Orchestration) → Glue (ETL Transformation) → S3 (Curated Data)**

---

## ⚙️ AWS Services Used

* **Amazon S3** → Raw data ingestion & curated storage
* **Amazon SQS** → Reliable event buffering
* **AWS Lambda** → Event-driven orchestration trigger
* **AWS Step Functions** → Workflow orchestration & retries
* **AWS Glue (PySpark)** → ETL transformation (cleaning, enrichment, validation)

---


## 🧹 Glue ETL Transformations

✔ Drop duplicates
✔ Handle null values (`Quantity`, `UnitPrice` → fill 0)
✔ Cast numeric columns
✔ Calculate `TotalAmount = Quantity * UnitPrice`
✔ Convert `OrderDate` to `yyyy-MM-dd` format
✔ Split valid vs invalid rows

Would you like me to also prepare a **GitHub repo structure (folders + files)** so you can upload your Glue script, architecture diagram, and sample dataset neatly?
